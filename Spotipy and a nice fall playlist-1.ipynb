When you're setting up your app it will probably also ask you for other things like a redirect URL - just put whatever you want in there, it doesn't matter.

    "# Your mission\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently came across a Spotify playlist called [Fall in a 90s Suburb](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7r2XnAUl6moWkcwOaWgihD?si=505c8f22f4314a33) while researching the band [SEAGULL SCREAMING KISS HER KISS HER](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1WSO9nf7wTj5DZBsncauGr?si=S0xpngxHR1mLF720lMZwxg). The playlist was pretty good, but since since SSKHKH only has like 1,500 listeners each month I was curious about the most/least popular songs on the playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the ten most popular songs on the playlist?\n",
    "2. What percentage of them have a popularity of zero? Print them out, sorted by the band name.\n",
    "3. Is popularity relative to the artist, the album, all songs on Spotify, or something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "### My suggested approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest approaching this through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Getting the playlist and print out its **name and description**. \n",
    "2. Print out **the name and popularity of each song**\n",
    "3. Print out **the name, popularity, and artists** of each track on the playlist. Or, if you'd like a shortcut, just pick the first artist.\n",
    "4. Instead of printing, use these to **create a new dictionary** each time you look at a track. Print out this dictionary. You should be printing out 476 dictionaries!\n",
    "5. Printing isn't helpful! Instead, after you create the dictionary **append it** to a list called `all_tracks`\n",
    "6. When you're done, `all_tracks` should have 476 items in it\n",
    "7. Sort the list by `popularity`, take the **top ten**\n",
    "8. Filter the list by `popularity`, selecting only the ones with a popularity of `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spotipy documentation:** https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spotify Web API documentation:** https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do this in many, many cells, not all in one!\n",
    "- You definitely want to [look at the Spotipy examples](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/tree/master/examples) to find some good code to base your answer off of. There are a handful that talk about playlists – it might be helpful to read and compare a few of them!\n",
    "- Getting the playlist name/description is **a different endpoint** than getting the actual songs on the playlist.\n",
    "- Are you printing out the **same number of tracks as are in the actual playlist?** Take note and be careful! It should be ~476.\n",
    "- If you're getting the id of playlist songs but not seeing song names, look for `fields='items.track.id,total` in your code. It's only pulling the track's id! Change it to `items.track,total` and it will return [more information about each track](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlists-tracks)\n",
    "- `all_tracks = []` should be the first line in your cell. That makes sure it always resets to being empty before you start adding tracks to it.\n",
    "- Be sure the first and last items in `all_tracks` are different – maybe you're accidentally adding the same item each time!\n",
    "- Normally we sort lists of numbers, which is easy. Sorting a list of dictionaries can be done easily with `key=`. Look it up!\n",
    "- Pick the most popular 10 songs using list comprehensions\n",
    "- Filtering is best done with a list comprehension.\n",
    "- You can sort by things that aren't numbers!"
