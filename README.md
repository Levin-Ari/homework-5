# Homework 5
# June 9-ish, 2025

Here is my old [portfolio](https://ari-levin.github.io/portfolio/) -- I need to make a new one. Sadly, I got locked out of my old Github account (long story), so updating it is much harder now. Why am I telling you this here?

I might continue writing stories in my homework. My brain tends to spill out whenever a text box is open. Not a great skill for consulting work.
